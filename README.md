# Application for choosing gifts

This is an application designed to help users choose gifts for other people. Users are able to make posts asking other people for advice. They can name who the gift is intended for and provide a brief description for more details. Others can read given posts and leave comments.

Every user has two tabs, one for their own posts and another for other people's posts.

Users need to create account and sign in before using this app.
